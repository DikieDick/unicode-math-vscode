# Features

## Autocompletion

In any language, when you type `\`, this extension will start suggesting possible latex input. 
Autocompletion will also preview the character that you are currently typing

**NOTICE**, when [LaTeX Workshop](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop) is activated, 
the `\` trigger seems to be taken by LaTeX Workshop, so completion won't work,
a workaround is type `\\`, then delete the first `\`. 


## Tab Commit

When you press tab after a LaTeX symbol, it will convert the LaTeX symbol into unicode.
The commit key can be changed by changing the keybinding for `unicode-math-input.commit`.

## Prefix 

Currently we support the following prefixes:

| Prefix  | LaTeX Command |
| --- | --- |
| `\^`  | superscript |
| `\_`  | subscript |
|`\b:` | bold |
|`\bf:` | bold |
|`\mathbf:` | bold |
|`\mathbf` | bold |
|`\i:` | italic |
|`\it:` | italic |
|`\mathit:` | italic |
|`\mathit` | italic |
|`\cal:` | `\mathcal` |
|`\mathcal:` | `\mathcal` |
|`\mathcal` | `\mathcal` |
|`\frak:` | `\mathfrak` |
|`\mathfrak:` | `\mathfrak` |
|`\mathfrak` | `\mathfrak` |
|`\Bbb:` | `\mathbb` |
|`\mathbb:` | `\mathbb` |
|`\mathbb` | `\mathbb` |

When you type a prefix, then a word (without space),
the extension will commit the unicode version of that font.
For example when you type `\it:text<tab>`, `\it:text` will be changed to `ùë°ùëíùë†ùë°`

**NOTICE**: not all common characters are supported in unicode, 
the extension will try its best to convert everything. 
For example `\_lazyfox<tab>` will give `‚Çó‚Çêzyf‚Çí‚Çì`.

# Roadmap

- [ ] custom trigger char other than `\` for each language (disable completion in language by setting trigger characters to `[]`).
- [ ] automated CI dependency update.
- [ ] automated CI documentation.
- [ ] when start with prefix, only convert the string when all can be converted.
- [ ] Screenshots/GIF on the readme
- [ ] reverse search prefix or latex command.
- [ ] more tests.
