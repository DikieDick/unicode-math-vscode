# Supported Features

## Autocomplete
All commands described below can be executed with either the [tab] or [space] key.  Executing a command with [tab] will insert the special symbols and leave the caret next to the inserted symbol.  [space] will add a space after the inserted symbol.

## Insert Symbols
Snippets to automatically convert symbol names to their corresponding unicode character.  
For instance typing '&#92;all' + [tab] will display '∀'. For a full list of supported symbols 
see [list here](https://github.com/mvoidex/UnicodeMath/blob/master/table.md).

## Superscript and Subscript
To convert a portion of text to a superscript or subscript just type 
'&#92;_123' or '&#92;^123' + [tab].  This will display ₁₂₃ or ¹²³.  For a full list of supported
subscript and superscript characters [see here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_subscripts_and_superscripts).
