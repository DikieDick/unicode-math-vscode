# Features

## Autocompletion

In any language, when you type `\`, this extension will start suggesting possible latex input. 
Autocompletion will also preview the character that you are currently typing

**NOTICE**, when [LaTeX Workshop](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop) is activated, 
the `\` trigger seems to be taken by LaTeX Workshop, 
you can set [custom trigger string](#custom-trigger-string) in the setting. 
I personally set the trigger strings as `["."]` in my LaTeX project. 


## Tab Commit

When you press tab after a LaTeX symbol, it will convert the LaTeX symbol into unicode.
The commit key can be changed by changing the keybinding for `unicode-math-input.commit`.

## Custom Trigger String

User can set custom trigger string from setting besides `\`.
they can be any strings, even `"LaTeX"`, and there can be multiple ones.
To disable this extension (typically used in LaTeX workspace),
just set the trigger strings to empty list.

## Prefix 

Currently we support the following prefixes:

| Prefix  | LaTeX Command |
| --- | --- |
| `^`  | superscript |
| `_`  | subscript |
|`b:` | bold |
|`bf:` | bold |
|`mathbf:` | bold |
|`mathbf` | bold |
|`i:` | italic |
|`it:` | italic |
|`mathit:` | italic |
|`mathit` | italic |
|`cal:` | `\mathcal` |
|`mathcal:` | `\mathcal` |
|`mathcal` | `\mathcal` |
|`frak:` | `\mathfrak` |
|`mathfrak:` | `\mathfrak` |
|`mathfrak` | `\mathfrak` |
|`Bbb:` | `\mathbb` |
|`mathbb:` | `\mathbb` |
|`mathbb` | `\mathbb` |

When you type a trigger string (like `\`) followed by prefix, then a word (without space),
the extension will commit the unicode version of that font.
For example when you type `\it:text<tab>`, `\it:text` will be changed to `ùë°ùëíùë†ùë°`

**NOTICE**: not all math font (including super and subscript) of common characters are supported in unicode.
When the char do not have the math font, the extension will not convert anything.
